## About Me
- I am an architectural designer and engineer specializing in parametric design and robotic fabrication. 
- My research focuses on robotic concrete printing, autonomous brick-stacking robot, algorithm design, and AI integration in design and fabrication, using Rhino/Grasshopper, Python, and ROS.
- Previously, I worked as a BIM designer on projects including social housing and landscape design. I'm passionate about digital construction and interdisciplinary innovation and welcome collaboration with like-minded professionals.
